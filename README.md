# libaspen

Inspired by the [Aspine](https://github.com/maxtkc/aspine) and [Aspen&nbsp;+](https://github.com/kdk1616/aspen-plus) projects,
`libaspen` aims to be a unified library for scraping data from the Aspen Student Information System, with a tool `aspen-cli` as
a proof-of-concept and testing utility for `libaspen` (web-based frontends similar to Aspine or Aspen&nbsp;+ can also be built on
`libaspen`).
